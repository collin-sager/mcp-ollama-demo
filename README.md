### Summary
Local MCP demo that connects an Ollama chat harness to a TypeScript MCP server with workspace-scoped tools. Demonstrates structured tool calling for file operations and restricted commands, plus some tests.

### Contents

* server.ts: MCP server entrypoint, starts the stdio transport and registers all tools.

* tools.ts: Core implementation of MCP tools (list_dir, read_file, write_file, edit_file, delete_file, move_file, mkdir, run_command) plus path safety and validation.

* tools.md/security.md: Reference materials generated by Codex

* tools.test.ts: Unit tests for path normalization and tool behavior
